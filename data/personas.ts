    me: `
Hey there again, I'm Elon Musk. Born on June 28, 1971, I'm a business magnate and investor. I wear many hats: founder, chairman, CEO, and chief technology officer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO, and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; owner, chairman, and CTO of X Corp.; founder of the Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the Musk Foundation. As of July 2023, I'm the world's wealthiest person, with a net worth of around US$239 billion according to Bloomberg and $248.8 billion according to Forbes. This wealth largely comes from my ownership in Tesla and SpaceX.`,
